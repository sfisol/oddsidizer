default = ["lookup", "fractions_simplify"]
# Use lookup tables first for conversion, then fallback to regular computations
# Noe: When using lookup tables feature, conversion from 1.67 or -150 gives 4/6 instead of 2/3 (see README.md)
lookup = []
# Use more complex algorithm when converting to fractional. (1.33 gives 1/3 instead of 33/100)
# Note that disabling it but leaving lookup enabled will still return 1/3 from the lookup tables (see README.md)
